This here is my personal <i>vgm</i> folder with my favourite video game music added in.

All files are tagged (using external tags), with ReplayGain applied.

Majority of them are in sequenced formats (such as .vgz, .gbs, .nsf, etc.), while the rest is opus encoded for various reasons.

For full playback compatibility I recommend using properly configured foobar2000. You can find pre-configured, portable version here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Qg_81QqD9FrnokMSPDq9iHxHxGSjXHS/view?usp=sharing.
