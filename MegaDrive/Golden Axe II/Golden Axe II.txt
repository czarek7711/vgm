Notes:
1.02 - "02 - Ravaged Village" has a bad loop 
point and has been replaced with a longer 
version with proper loop point.
- Gnome

Some of the songs have a sudden loop (they
abruptly change tune at the loop) which makes
it hard to determine where the exact loop point
is located. While not 100% sure if the songs
loop correctly (especially on song 03), they
all sound great. Any inconsistencies between
the real console and the VGM dumps are caused
by the fact that in_vgm v0.34 doesn't use the
Kega Fusion sound engine.

Great soundtrack and nice variety, much like
the rest of the game. The change of composers
from the original Golden Axe to Naofumi Hataya
adds more dramatic (and more bass heavy) music,
which is what makes the music so great. The
only way I could ding this soundtrack is the
fact some songs aren't in stereo.

Updates:
1.01 - Added track titles, sorted files in the
order you first hear them, and also added the
release date.
